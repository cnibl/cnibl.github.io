title: DEATH IN SPACE
---

**DEATH IN SPACE** is a table-top roleplaying game about the miners, drillers and other workers that are stuck in the war-ravaged Tenebris system, just waiting for the next big score. They're hungry for contracts and adventure, and take the jobs they can get from anonymous corporations and the others who have carved out seats of power in this harsh place. 

And if war wasn't enough, rumor has it that the Universe is dying, accelerating towards a future big crunch. And the rate is increasing, sped up by the blackness of space itself. The ***VOID*** corrupts and infects, whispering strange words through white noise that grows more intense every day.
