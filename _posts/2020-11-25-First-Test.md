title: DEATH IN SPACE
---

DEATH IN SPACE is a table-top roleplaying game about miners, drillers and other workers stuck in the war-ravaged Tenebris system, just waiting for a big score. They're hungry for contracts and adventure, and take the jobs they can get from anonymous corporations. 

And if war wasn't enough, rumor has it that the Universe is dying, accelerating towards a future big crunch. And the rate is increasing, sped up by the blackness of space itself. The void corrupts and infects, whispering strange words through a static that never disappears.
